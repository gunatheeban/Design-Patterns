# Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the Design Patterns Repository! This resource is crafted to help developers understand and implement various software design patterns. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn about design patterns or an experienced developer seeking to refine your design approach, this repository provides practical examples in a way that is easy to understand and apply.

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern represents a best practice used by experienced developers. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

## Patterns Covered

### Creational Patterns
- **Singleton**: Ensures that a class has only one instance while providing a global access point to this instance.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.
- **Factory Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

### Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

## Using This Repository

Each pattern is contained in its own directory, complete with examples and a detailed explanation of how and when to use the pattern. Navigate to the directory of the pattern you're interested in to find relevant source code and a README specific to that pattern.
